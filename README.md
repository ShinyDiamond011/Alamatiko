# Alamatiko

> A mobile application dedicated to preserving and celebrating Filipino oral literature — bringing the legends and epics of the Philippines to life through interactive storytelling and rich multimedia.

<br>

## Overview

**Alamatiko** is an Android mobile application built to digitally preserve and promote two of the most significant forms of Filipino cultural heritage: **Alamat** (origin myths and legends) and **Epiko** (folk epics). As oral traditions increasingly risk being forgotten in the digital age, Alamatiko provides an accessible, engaging platform for students, educators, and cultural enthusiasts to explore these stories.

The app combines curated literary content with an intuitive reading experience, aiming to make Filipino folklore relevant and engaging for modern audiences — particularly the younger generation.

<br>

## Purpose & Motivation

The Philippines has a rich tradition of oral storytelling that predates written history. Many of these stories — the Alamat of the pineapple, the Epiko of Lam-ang, the Maranao tales of Darangen — are at risk of being lost as they are rarely encountered outside of academic settings.

**Alamatiko** was built to:
- Give these stories a permanent, accessible digital home
- Present them in a format that appeals to younger readers
- Support Filipino cultural education inside and outside the classroom
- Document and organize oral literature by region and genre

<br>

## Features

- ** Story Library** — Curated collection of Alamat and Epiko organized by category
- ** Category Browsing** — Browse by story type (Alamat / Epiko), region (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao), or featured collections
- ** Reader View** — Clean, distraction-free reading interface optimized for mobile
- ** Multimedia Content** — Rich visual imagery and illustrations accompanying each story
- ** Offline Support** — Recently viewed stories are cached locally for offline reading
